The world has a `/uses` page and why shouldn't I?

Here's the gear on my desk that fuels my work:

- Laptop: M2 Max Macbook Pro - 32G / 1T
- Monitor: LG C148 OLED
- Speakers: Samsung HW-Q990B
- Microphone: Fifine T669B
- Headphones: Sony WH-1000XM5 for when I need to move around and HiFiMan Sundara paired with FiiO K5 Pro for when I need to bathe in music
- Keyboard: [Fifi](https://github.com/raychengy/fifi_split_keeb) with the famous [Miryoku Keymap](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku)
- Mouse: Glorious Model D Wireless (soon to be replaced by a USB C Magic Trackpad if Apple ever is kind enough to release one)
