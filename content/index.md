## Intro

Welcome to my little space on the internet! 

I am [[resume.pdf|an infrastructure guy]] / [[resume.pdf|aspiring devops]], [a waning cinephile](https://letterboxd.com/kayg04/films/diary/) and [a recreational weightlifter](https://youtube.com/@kayglifts). I work at [croit GmbH](https://croit.io); we make deploying and managing ceph super simple! 

This little space is also my second brain. Instead of relying on formal blog posts, I have decided to try out putting out notes from my zettelkasten as updates. 

You might be interested in [[services|using the services that I host]], [[uses|my workspace]] and [my notes](https://kayg.org/Permanent-Notes/). If you notice any incorrect information or issues with the website, please [notify me with an email](mailto:mail@kayg.org).
